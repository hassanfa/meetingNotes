AE:

- Danger associated molecular products (DAMPs)

  - Calreticulin
  - HMGB1
  - IL-1B, etc

- 7 steps of multi combination therapy: (Cancer cell immunity cycle)

  - release of cancer cell antigens
  - cancer antigen presenation
  - priming and activation
  - tracfficking of tcells to tumor
  - infiltration tcells into tumor
  - recognition of cancer cells by tcell
  - killing of cancer cells _ immuno-combo strategy:
  - target activator and inhibtors?

- other strats:

  - IDO inhibitors
  - Oncolytic viruses
  - CAR tcells
  - bi spe
  - Cytokines

TN:

- Improve diag pathways

  - PHI and 4K score have same performance

- PSA has lower sensitivity and higher specificity compared to other methods

- MRI/targeted biopsy has lowest sensitivity for Gleason Score 6\. For Gleason score 7, all others (traditional, biopsy, MRI/systematic) perform similar

HG:

- Higher mortality rate from Prostate cancer than Breast Cancer
- AI pathology for prostate cancer Liquid biopsy
- Blood sample DNA or RNA
- localized cancer and early detection "detection and localization of surgically resectable cancer, Science 2018"
- Mutant allele fraction "Concordance of circulating tumor DNA and matched in prostate cancer, JNCI 2017"
- Tracking clonal evolution during disease progression
- ctDNA is a better marker than PSA for early prostate cancer

JH:

- In paedriatic cancers the rate of somatic mutations is lower
- Fusions can be a biomarker for tumor specific drug targets
- Maher et al nature 000, 1-5, 2009 doi:10.1038
- High-risk fusions are enriched for TF binding sites -

JC:

- traditional vs kryotypically complex sarcoma

XL:

- on p53 targeting
- DAN damage and its increase in stress signal has relations with p53.
- Increase of p53 expression can cause apoptosis in some cancers but not others
- How TFs do target selective transcription in different tissues
- Ankyrin repeats in domains
- In most cancers, p53 mutation rate is following mutational burden (or somatic mutation prevalence), except in melanoma where p53 has lower mutation rate while there is a high mutational burden in melanoma

MR:

- Predictive medicine
- Multiple outcomes as an input for the model
- Application is to replicate Gleason Score and presence of prostate cancer

GB:

- Non-specific markers for MLL exist (~25% of all cases)

## Breakout seasons: Novel methods and technologies

AFG:

- padlock probes, cDNA, circularize it, etc
- One nucleotide at a time, detectable targets increase
- In situ sequencing has limited application in number of targets detecting through multiple cycles. e.g. there are 4 nucleotides, so 4^N targets can be detected through each cycle. At 4 cycles, 256 targets can be detected
- Gene ratio for each slice of in situ sequencing was defined as high divided by low (high/low). Why not take log2?
- Deep machine learning? features?
- Very low sensitivity

MW:

- Genetic makeup of tumor that can cause systemic inflammation
- <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29562192>

JdB:

- Add a radioactive blue dye to the tumor. This way lymph nodes that are metastasized are detected and removed
- SENOMAC trial
- She is like negative Halsted

OA:

- PROMORT 2 and deep learning of morphological features of prostate cancer

KES:

- immune suppression or stimulation as a strategy for lymphoma

PH:

- Primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention
- Reduce cancer risk by removing infectious diseases
- Precision prevention: find who is benefitting the most from prevention. There are ess than 10 FDA-approved interventions aimed at preventing cancer
- <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29076966>
- <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4446723/>
- Twins with discordant risk of cancer: Epigenetics

KT:

- 3D view of organs
- Lipids have highest light refraction
